# Measurements Table

## Introduction

The **Measurements data table** represents the core data table of the
eData format. This table records actual measured parameter values
(including uncertainty), and references most other tables using foreign
keys.

This table is built from the [Samples data
table](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/samples_data.md)
and optionally the [Biota data
table](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/biota_data.md) if
present. Both tables are bound together (that is, the rows of one are
added below the other) and then extended with additional columns. The
inclusion of columns in this table and their order is somewhat a

## Variables

### Site Code

`SITE_CODE` - *string, free, mandatory*

[Site
Code](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/sites_data.html#site-code)
is a foreign key that references the [Sites data
table](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/sites_data.md).
During Samples table creation the user selects relevant sites using
their code and name.

### Parameter Name

`PARAMETER_NAME` - *string, free, mandatory*

[Parameter
name](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/parameters_data.html#parameter-name)
is a foreign key that references the [Parameter data
table](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/parameter_data.md).
During Samples table creation the user selects relevant parameters using
their name and type.

### Sampling Date

`SAMPLING_DATE` - *string, free, mandatory*

Transcribed from [Sampling
Date](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/samples_data.html#sampling-date)
in the Samples data.

### Environmental Sub-Compartment

`ENVIRON_COMPARTMENT_SUB` - *string, controlled, mandatory*

Transcribed from [Environmental
Sub-Compartment](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/samples_data.html#environmental-sub-compartment)
in the Samples data table.

### Subsample

`SUBSAMPLE` - *string, free, mandatory*

Transcribed from
[Subsample](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/samples_data.html#subsample)
in the Samples data table.

### Measured Flag

`MEASURED_FLAG` - *string, controlled, mandatory*

A flag to indicate if the data source reported a measured value (blank)
or that it was below the [limit of detection](#lod-value) or [limit of
quantification](#loq-value). In the latter cases, [Measured
value](#measured-value) becomes optional, but it is mandatory to
complete at least one of LOQ/LOD.

#### Controlled Vocabulary

``` r
measured_flag_vocabulary()
#> [1] ""      "< LOQ" "< LOD"
```

### Measured Value

`MEASURED_VALUE` - *numeric, free, conditionally mandatory*

The numeric measured value of the parameter, if available.

### Uncertainty Type

`UNCERTAINTY_TYPE` - *string, controlled, mandatory*

Many [Measured values](#measured-value) are reported as aggregated
statistics with uncertainty bounds (mean, mode, etc; 95% CI, SD, SE,
range, etc.). Uncertainty Type provides a non-exhaustive classification
system for these.

Where the data source reports uncertaintly, the
[Upper](#uncertainty-upper-bound) and [Lower](#uncertainty-lower-bound)
should also be reported.
