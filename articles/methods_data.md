# Methods data

## Introduction

Methodology can significantly affect measured values, and this
information is vital to understanding the overall environmental context.
In the **Methods data** table, we classify methodology into four
categories:

1.  Sampling protocol: how were physical samples or information
    collected from the environment?
2.  Extraction protocol: how was a substance of interest (analyte)
    extracted from its matrix?
3.  Fractionation protocol: what fraction of the analyte was analysed?
    how was this fraction obtained?
4.  Analytical protocol: what analytical techniques were used to
    determine the quantity of analyte in the sample?

These methodologies are structured for the collection of data on
chemicals stressors, which reflects the dominant use case of the format
so far. Extension to cover a greater range of non-chemical stressors is
planned for future versions.

Currently no external ontology or taxonomy is used for methodology. The
[Chemical Methods Ontology](https://github.com/rsc-ontology/rsc-cmo)
(CMO) may be appropriate, and we will continue to review its progress to
determine the appropriate form of any harmonisation.

The Methods table is a metadata table that is transformed before being
linked to the [Measurements
table](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/measurements_data.md).
Because it is assumed that each measurement will typically have a
sampling, extraction, fractionation, and analytical protocol associated
with it, the measurements table has a foreign key for each type of
methdology that references the relevant [Protocol ID](#protocol-id).

``` r
library(eDataDRF)
```

``` r
initialise_methods_tibble()
#> # A tibble: 0 × 5
#> # ℹ 5 variables: PROTOCOL_ID <chr>, CAMPAIGN_NAME <chr>,
#> #   PROTOCOL_CATEGORY <chr>, PROTOCOL_NAME <chr>, PROTOCOL_COMMENT <chr>
```

## Variables

### Protocol ID

`PROTOCOL_ID` - *string, free, mandatory*

A short, terse identifier for the protocol. This is used as a primary
key for Methods data and a foreign key in the Sampling Protocol,
Extraction Protocol, Fractionation Protocol, and Analytical Protocol
columns. [Measurements
data](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/measurements_data.md).

Protocol IDs are automatically generated based on the protocol type,
short name, campaign name, and, in cases where more than one of a type
of technique is used per campaign, sequence number. This is
theoretically vulnerable to colisions, and a hashed or serial key would
be safer, but this is not anticipated to be a problem at the current
scale of use at the format. Additionally, it is far easier to read and
intepret for humans.

``` r
generate_protocol_id(
  protocol_type = "Analytical Protocol",
  protocol_name = "ICP-MS",
  sequence_number = 1,
  campaign_name = "Test_Campaign"
)
#> [1] "A01_ICPMS_TestCampai"
```

### Campaign Name

`CAMPAIGN_NAME` - *string, free, mandatory*

A short, terse identifier for the campaign. Foreign key referenced from
[Campaign
data](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/campaign_data.md),
used to generate [Protocol ID](#protocol-id).

### Protocol Category

`PROTOCOL_CATEGORY` - *string, controlled vocabulary, mandatory*

The category of protocol/method (Sampling, Extraction, Fractionation,
Analytical).

``` r
protocol_categories_vocabulary()
#> [1] "Sampling Protocol"      "Fractionation Protocol" "Extraction Protocol"   
#> [4] "Analytical Protocol"
```

### Protocol Name

`PROTOCOL_NAME` - *string, controlled vocabulary, mandatory*

The consensus name (short and long) of a protocol or method used in
sampling. Options are currently based on the aquatic ecotoxicology
domain, but will be extended and harmonised with relevant ontologies and
taxonomies as practical.

### Protocol Comment

`PROTOCOL_COMMENT` - *string, free, optional*

Space for the recording of any additional notes or comments about the
method deemed relevant. As information on the specific equipment or more
detailed protocols may also be useful, users are encouraged to copy
relevant text verbatim from the source.
