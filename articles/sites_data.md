# Sites data

## Introduction

Sites data captures information about the coordinates, land use, and
administrative/geographical boundaries of sampling sites. In this
format, we make the distinction between the sampled site - a fixed,
physical point in space - and the
[compartment](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/compartments_data.md) -
the type of medium sampled.

Sampling sites are often reported in a variety of more-or-less FAIR
formats, despite the availability of free, mature, well-characterised
systems for defining position in space. Extraction of such data from
reference objects may require conversion from minute-degrees to decimal
degrees, reprojection in a different Coordinate Reference System,
merging of multiple sampling sites, reporting a large, vague sampling
region as a single point, and estimating coordinates off maps. However,
for the time being, the format is kept intentionally simple. All sites
are reported as discrete points; and cases where any of the above
operations are performed should be reported in the [comments
field](#site-comment---string-free-optional).

## Variables

### Site Code - String, free, mandatory

`SITE_CODE`

A short, unique code identifying the sampled site. Although formatting
is not enforced on this field, we recommend using an abbreviated
combination of the campaign, long form site name and any details
relevant to the site. For example:

“Arctic Monitoring Program; Pelagic Sampling Point 37” -\>
`AMP-Pelagic-37`. The site code is the primary key for sites data and is
used as a foreign key in
[samples](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/samples_data.md)
and
[measurements](https://NIVANorge.github.io/eDataDRF/articles/measurements_data.md).

### Site Name - String, free, mandatory

`SITE_NAME`

A longer form name of the site, potentially including details such as
address, region, site type, etc. May be fully copied from source to
enable easy tracing back of the relevant details.

### Site Geographic Feature - String, controlled, mandatory

`SITE_GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURE`

Categorisation of site type allows for broad comparisons to be made.
Site Geographic feature is based on a variety of existing land-use
taxonomy to facilitate conversion and comparison:

- [LUCAS Land Use Cover
  Hierachy](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=LUCAS_-_Land_use_and_land_cover_survey)
  (EU)
- [CORINE Land Cover
  inventory](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover)
  (EU)
- Water Framework Directive water body types
- Marine Something Framework Directive water types

These are summarised in the table below

### Site Geographic Feature Sub - String, controlled, mandatory

`SITE_GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURE_SUB`

In some cases geographic feature vocabulary may not have enough
resolution to capture sampling sites. For example, in bodies of water,
it may be important to distinguish between samples from the benthos,
water column, water surface, etc. In this case, sub-features can be used
to add additional precision.

#### Controlled Vocabulary

``` r
geographic_features_sub_vocabulary()
#> [1] "Not relevant"               "Not reported"              
#> [3] "Water surface"              "Water column, pelagic zone"
#> [5] "Water benthos"              "Other"
```

### ISO Country - String, controlled, mandatory

`COUNTRY_ISO`

Although the sheer size of countries makes them at times poor
identifiers of geographical location, they remain useful data. Although
this variable is marked as mandatory, it is possible to enter “Not
relevant” when sites are out of the territory of any nation (e.g. in
international waters). The [ISO 3166 set of country
codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) is used, via the
R package `{iso}`.

### IHO Ocean/Sea - String, controlled, mandatory

`OCEAN_IHO`

As with countries, oceans are not necessarily the best geographical
identifiers, but they provide useful, human-readable data for
understanding sampling sites. The [International Hydrographic
Organisation’s version 3 Sea Areas](https://doi.org/10.14284/323)
dataset is used to provide a reasonably-standardised set of names for
seas and oceans. As with
[Country](#iso-country---string-controlled-mandatory), Ocean is
mandatory but should be marked as “Not relevant” when the site is on
land.

Where sampling sites are located in national territory but also in or
near (intentionally vague) an ocean or sea, we recommend recording both
variables.

### Latitude - Numeric, free, mandatory

`LATITUDE`

Site latitude (north-south position, also known as northing, between
-90.0° and +90.0°) is recorded in decimal decimal degrees. Arbitrary
precision (within the bounds of R’s numeric data type) is possible, but
the degree of precision reported (i.e. decimal places) should be
appropriate to the actual sampling. 3 decimal places corresponds to
approximately 111 m accuracy, and 4 to within 11 m. Under some
circumstances this can cause somewhat confusing combinations of
coordinates and site types; for example, a site may be reported as being
on land but with coordinates that are clearly in the ocean. In future,
we plan to include an explicit metric of spatial uncertainty. A latitude
is always associated with a [Coordinate Reference
System](#coordinate-reference-system---string-controlled-mandatory).

### Longitude - Numeric, free, mandatory

`LONGITUDE`

Site longitude (east-west position, also known as easting, between
-180.0° and +180.0°) is recorded in decimal decimal degrees. See
[Latitude](#latitude---numeric-free-mandatory) for further details. A
longitude is always associated with a [Coordinate Reference
System](#coordinate-reference-system---string-controlled-mandatory).

### Coordinate Reference System - String, controlled, mandatory

`SITE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM`

A site’s latitude and longitude are calculated using a reference system
“placed” at a given point on the globe and parameterised within a given
region. This Coordinate Reference System is a necessary component of any
geographical coordinate data. In most global datasets, the World
Geodetic System, 1984 version (WGS 84) is used. However, national or
other local datasets may use a variety of CRS, such as the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM), which projects the Earth into a series of
square or rectangular zones; in this case, it is necessary to know the
CRS and the grid number.

This controlled vocabulary uses the package `{crsuggest}`, which in turn
uses the EPSG Dataset v10.019, (product of the International Association
of Oil & Gas Producers, [terms of
use](https://epsg.org/terms-of-use.html)). However, because the full
6000+ CRS included would be impractically large for the associated UI,
we filter this down to a small set of systems relevant to the test cases
used with the format so far. In future, CRS metadata will be used to
automatically filter available CRS based on the desired geographical
scope.

#### Controlled Vocabulary

``` r
coordinate_systems_vocabulary(common_only = TRUE)
#> [1] "Not relevant"          "Not reported"          "WGS 84"               
#> [4] "ETRS89"                "WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N" "WGS 84 / UTM zone 33N"
#> [7] "WGS 84 / UTM zone 34N" "WGS 84 / UTM zone 35N" "Other"
```

### Altitude Value - Numeric, free, mandatory

`ALTITUDE_VALUE`

Altitude value above or below sea level, including depth of water
sampling (but *not* depth of ice or sediment cores). This data is
frequently not available for sampling sites, in which case it can be
reported as 0. Associated with an [altitude
unit](#altitude-unit---string-controlled-mandatory).

### Altitude Unit - String, controlled, mandatory

`ALTITUDE_UNIT`

Unit associated with [altitude
value](#altitude-value---numeric-free-mandatory).

#### Controlled Vocabulary

``` r
altitude_units_vocabulary()
#> [1] "km" "m"  "cm" "mm"
```

### Entered By - String, free, mandatory

`ENTERED_BY`

The name or email address of the user entering data.

### Entered Date - Date (ISO), free, mandatory

`ENTERED_DATE`

The date that site data were entered.

### Site Comment - String, free, optional

`SITE_COMMENT`

Space for the recording of any additional notes or comments about the
site deemed relevant, particularly any operations performed by the user
on sites data, such as merging sites, converting a sampling region to a
discrete point, or estimating point coordinates from a map.
