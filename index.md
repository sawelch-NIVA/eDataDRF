# eData Data Reporting Format

The eData Data Reporting Format is a format for the standardisation of
data on pollutant occurence in the environment. By converting this data
to a single, consistent format, it makes it easier to validate, compare,
analyse, and reuse, in line with the [FAIR
principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

These data are typically published as concentrations (in water) or mass
ratios (in soil, sludge and biota). Fully interpreting these
measurements requires considerable metadata, relating to the time,
place, conditions, methodology, and context of sampling. However, no
single standard exists for these metadata, and study authors and
sampling teams tend to use a variety of inconsistent definitions, units,
and schema depending on their scientific domain and the study’s
individual needs.

This is not, in itself a problem. However, as environmental risk
assessment becomes more data-based and larger scale, the need to use and
re-use large quantities of data increases. When these datasets are
consistent, validated, and interoperable, much time can be saved. When
they are not, researchers much go through the tedious process of
understanding, validating and remapping by hand; an often
non-reproducible process. Thus a harmonised format - and associated
validation and formatting functions - can represent a significant
timesaver for anyone in such as position.

This format is a (first) attempt to address this issue. Rather than
attempt a perfect format that covers all relevant domains, we have
elected to focus on pollutants in water, aquatic biota, and similar
compartments (sludge, aquatic sediment, etc.).
